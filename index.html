              The map in Figure 1 shows the average house prices in each Local Government Area (LGA) normalised by the 
              number of bedrooms within each house. The average price per bedroom in the map looks to increase the 
              closer to the city centre it is. This is shown by the LGA which the highest average house price is 
              Stonnington with an average of AUD$833,333 per bedroom. Additionally the LGA with the lowest average 
              price per bedroom is Melton with an average of AUD$123,667 per bedroom.

              This plot, Figure 2, shows what to expect in terms of house prices for the number of 
              bedrooms. A selector at the bottom of the page can be used to change the LGA considered. The lowest 
              points in each column represent the minimum price a house has been sold for in the area considered. The 
              blue region is the interquatile range which is the region in which 50% of the houses considered have been sold 
              for the number of bedrooms, with a white line representing the median house price. The maximum line 
              encloses the Price range of 95% of houses sold for that number of bedrooms, the points outside of 
              this area show outlyers which should not be considered unless looking for a house with many luxuries.
